<p><strong>HOMEWORK WEEK 6</strong></p>
<p><em>Christina Aguilera has reinvented herself many times. How has her style changed over time and which one has triumphed the most? Look at the audio features for each major album, and see if you can cluster them into distinct style periods.</em> </p>
<p>Christina Aguilera is an American artist who began her career from a very young age in children's television programs. However, she became famous in the late 1990s when she was part of the original soundtrack for Disney's <em>Mulan</em> with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8GUCQQZS64"><em>Reflection</em></a>. Her discography is made up of 10 albums, several singles and the album of the film <em>Burlesque</em>, in which she was the protagonist and of which album she is the singer of the majority of songs. </p>
<p>In this work I will analyze how she has varied throughout his albums of musical genres, from pop, R&B, blues, dance pop, electropop, soul, hip hop and circus style. To do this, I will choose several songs from each album, based also on the list <em>This is: Christina Aguilera</em> of Spotify, in order to analyze which genre is exposed in each album. Therefore, some of the songs to be analysed according to the genre will be: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PstrAfoMKlc"><em>Fighter</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQa7SvVCdZk"><em>Lady Marmalade</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScjucUV8v0"><em>Candyman</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rg3sAb8Id8"><em>Dirrty</em> (feat. Redman)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x7Ta89QLo4"><em>Ain't no other man</em></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA"><em>Genie in a bottle</em></a>. Finally, and after giving each album a specific genre or majority (since some albums have several genres in it) I will analyze thanks to RStudio data which album, and thus which genre, had more popularity.</p>

<p>As first data, I have found in RStudio the following table where you can appreciate the popularity of each album by Christina Aguilera. At first glance we can see how the album <em>Christina Aguilera (Expanded Edition)</em> has a higher value in the popularity index (Int = 72) and the album <em>Lotus (Deluxe Version)</em> has a lower value (Int = 3).</p>
<p>These data will help to determine epochs of style and musical genre of Christina Aguilera and at the same time, which of these genres have been better received by the public.</p>
